# @coderifts/agent-guard

Fail-closed guard for AI agent tool calls — preflight contract changes before they execute.

Security core **FROZEN** (agent-guard-api v1.0). Built on [`@coderifts/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coderifts/sdk) `^1.1.1`.

```bash
npm install @coderifts/agent-guard @coderifts/sdk
```

```typescript
import { guardToolCall } from '@coderifts/agent-guard';
import { CodeRifts } from '@coderifts/sdk';

const client = new CodeRifts({ apiKey: 'cr_live_...' });

const outcome = await guardToolCall(
  {
    toolName: 'Edit',
    arguments: { path: 'openapi.yaml' },
    // Supply the contract change as artifacts[] with before/after content — this is what the
    // server preflights. `id`/`type`/`before`/`after` are all required for each artifact.
    artifacts: [{ id: 'public-api', type: 'openapi', before: baseSpec, after: proposedSpec }],
  },
  // The mutating work is created ONLY here, after the verdict — never eagerly (closes TOCTOU).
  async (envelope, redactedCall) => applyEdit(redactedCall),
  { client, operation: 'merge', environment: 'production' },
);

if (!outcome.executed) console.error('blocked:', outcome.verdict);
// Retry ONLY when outcome.executionAttempted === false (the safe-to-retry signal).
```

> **Supply `artifacts[]` with content.** If the guard detects a contract change (e.g. from
> `filesTouched`/`diff`) but you did **not** supply `artifacts[]` with `before`/`after`, it fails
> closed **locally** with `outcome.verdict.cause === 'MISSING_ARTIFACT_CONTENT'` — the tool does not
> execute and the error is *actionable* (pass the change as artifacts), not a package failure. The
> guard never sends an empty change set to the server.

### Guarding the whole tool surface (inescapability)

`guardToolCall` guards one call. To make CodeRifts the **only** path a mutating tool can take, wrap
your entire tool list with [`guardToolRegistry`](#) — it returns the sole tool table the agent may
see (every mutator wrapped, fail-closed at construction if any would remain raw):

```typescript
import { guardToolRegistry } from '@coderifts/agent-guard';

const { tools, coverage } = guardToolRegistry(rawTools, { guard: { client } });
// register ONLY `tools` with your agent SDK; coverage === 'COMPLETE' ⇒ no mutator is reachable raw.
```

## Guarantees (tsc-verified)

- **Fail-closed by default** — any ambiguity, integrity failure, or unknown state resolves to `STOP`.
- **No TOCTOU** — the factory creates the mutating work *after* the verdict.
- **Retry-safe** — `executionAttempted` is the only safe-to-retry signal; a post-authorization throw
  is `executionAttempted:true` (the remote side effect may have landed).
- **`enforced:true` only on a LIVE, receipt-verified `ALLOW`/`MONITOR`** — never on cached/LKG,
  SKIPPED, observeOnly, or fail-open paths (unrepresentable at compile time).
- **Integrity failures never fail open** — a bad signature, schema-invalid response, detector/config
  error, or request-attributable rejection (413/422) always resolves closed + trips the breaker.

## Trigger detection

`builtinDetector` (fail-safe, versioned) decides whether a tool call touches a contract artifact
(OpenAPI/GraphQL/gRPC/AsyncAPI/MCP manifest/migrations/CI gates). Precedence: explicit artifacts >
filesTouched patterns > diff/content markers > toolName > intent (add-only). Ambiguity triggers
(`confident=false ⇒ trigger=true`). It passes all 68 vectors of the Grok trigger corpus.

See `agent-guard-api.FROZEN-v1.0.md` for the full frozen contract.
